# Use Cases


Use cases that are accepted by the working group are considered as the working group determines what facilities to put in its recommendations. To submit a new use case for consideration by the working group, create a new page issue in this repository using the Use Case template.

Use a descriptive issue title for your use case. Add information about your use case to the template. The more information you provide the more likely it is that your use case will have an effect on the results of the working group. Be sure to add your contact information so that you can be contacted as your use case is considered by the working group. You can utilize existing use cases as examples.

See https://github.com/pfps/use-cases/wiki/Use-Case-Process for more information about the working group's use case proces..
